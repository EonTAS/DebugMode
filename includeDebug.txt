Collision Manager Render Debug
=====
drawCollisionList(collisionObject r3) - 0x80541F90
drawCollision(segmentData r3, collisionData r4) - 0x80541F94

=====
Toggles
=====
0 = display hurtboxes/hitboxes. 0 = no, 1 = hurtboxes only, 2 = body and hurtboxes
1 = stage render, 0 = no, 1 = stage + render, 2 = just render, stage cant properly be reenabled currently
2 = setting of area manager, 
3 = ecb etc draw
4 = blastzone render and stuff

TODO
====
Remake frame advance in a friendly way, temp method done, needs to be changed to flip 2nd bit of pause function.
	l-r-dpaddown 	= enable all toggles
	x + dpad up 	= pause
	r + dpad right 	= 1x = hurtbox visualisation on, 2x = hurtbox + bodys on
	 

fix subspace enemies - waiting for brawlcrate bugfix
better map out toggles
fix spheres to not have dumb strip
better stage render toggle so it can be reenabled safely
potentially give hurtboxes a hurtbox angle display
